This is the repository for codenameBirdBox. More details to come shortly.

### Technologies
Codename BirdBox is built on Python3.7 and Flask. Additional technologies include:
* SQL Lite and SQL Alchemy for database and database connections
* WTForms for data entry 
* Werkzeug for password hashing and additional security
* Raspberry Pi as a server and mechanical components 

Special thanks to the [Flask Mega Tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world)
which was invaluable in getting our boilerplate code and basic authentication created.
